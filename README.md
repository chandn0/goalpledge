# GoalPledge

GoalPledge is a motivational to-do list application designed to help you achieve your goals by adding a financial stake to your tasks.

## How it works

- **Set Your Goals:** Create tasks and set deadlines for what you want to accomplish.
- **Stake Your USDC:** For each task, you stake an amount of USDC. This amount is held in escrow as your commitment to the goal.
- **Complete on Time:** Mark your goal as complete before the deadline.
- **Claim Your Stake:** Once a goal is successfully completed on time, your staked USDC is released back to you.


## Features: 

###  Community Challenges
- Browse and join challenges created by others. Compete in a global community of goal-setters.

### Friend Beneficiary
- Set a friend's address to receive your stake if you fail. Support a friend or charity.

### Group Challenges
- Create competitive challenges where winners share the losers' stakes. May the best person win!
