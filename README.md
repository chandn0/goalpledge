# GoalPledge

GoalPledge is a motivational to-do list application designed to help you achieve your goals by adding a financial stake to your tasks.

## How it works

- **Set Your Goals:** Create tasks and set deadlines for what you want to accomplish.
- **Stake Your USDC:** For each task, you stake an amount of USDC. This amount is held in escrow as your commitment to the goal.
- **Complete on Time:** Mark your goal as complete before the deadline.
- **Claim Your Stake:** Once a goal is successfully completed on time, your staked USDC is released back to you.
- **Track Your Progress:** The app organizes your tasks by date, showing you what's "Upcoming". You can also view your "Completed" and "Missed" tasks.
- **Stay Motivated:** The total staked amount is always visible, reminding you of what's on the line.
